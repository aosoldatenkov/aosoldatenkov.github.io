<h2>Introduction to the Moduli Spaces of Sheaves on K3 Surfaces</h2>

<p>
  The minicourse will consist of 5-6 lectures and its aim will be to introduce the moduli spaces
  of semistable coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety X, mainly focusing on the case
  when X is a K3 surface. The reason for choosing K3 surfaces is that the moduli spaces of sheaves
  in this case carry a rich geometric structure – they are holomorphic symplectic varieties.
  Therefore they serve as one of the main sources of examples of compact hyperkähler manifolds,
  and the minicourse may be considered a complement to Verbitsky’s lecture course on hyperkähler geometry.
  The theory of moduli spaces of sheaves is technically quite complicated, and I will mainly avoid
  giving all the details of the proofs, focusing mainly on the ideas and methods of working
  with the moduli spaces. The tentative list of topics to be discussed:
