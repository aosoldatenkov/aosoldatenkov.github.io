    <p><strong>Title:</strong>Resurgence in enumerative geometry</p>
    <p class="justify">Gromov–Witten and Donaldson–Thomas invariants are
      enumerative invariants that can be defined for any Calabi–Yau threefold.
      Roughly speaking, GW invariants count holomorphic curves together with a
      parametrisation while DT invariants count them together with the data
      of the equations defining them. These two different ways of interpreting
      a curve lead to different behaviour under degenerations and so
      different counts. Nevertheless, it has been conjectured by
      Maulik–Nekrasov–Okounkov–Pandharipande that knowing any one of
      these two sets of invariants is sufficient to completely determine the
      other. Motivated by physical intuition from topological string theory,
      we shall be exploring in this talk an elegant realisation of this
      equivalence in the case of the resolved conifold, a particular example
      of a noncompact Calabi–Yau threefold, within the framework of resurgence
      theory. This is based on joint work with Murad Alim, Jörg Teschner, and Iván
      Tulli.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Hölder potentials in hyperkähler dynamics</p>
    <p class="justify">Cantat and Dinh-Sibony studied so called dynamic currents associated to
      hyperbolic automorphisms of Calabi-Yau manifolds. They are defined as
      eigenvectors in H^{1,1} with eigenvalue >1. They are of interest in
      dynamics, because they allow to construct dynamically interesting
      measures, and for algebraic geometry they provide examples of rigid
      currents. I will describe the circle of ideas around these themes and
      report on a work in progress with Misha Verbitsky generalizing a theorem
      of Dinh and Sibony stating that potentials of dynamic currents are
      Hölder functions.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> An invitation to the Gross–Siebert programme</p>
    <p class="justify">
      The Strominger–Yau–Zaslow conjecture is a geometric shadow of mirror symmetry
      that interprets mirror manifolds as dual special lagrangian fibrations over
      the same base. The naive statement of the conjecture turns out to be false but
      may be rescued in certain large complex structure limits. The toric degeneration
      programme due to Mark Gross and Bernd Siebert is an algebro-geometric realisation
      of the above conjectural statement motivated by a class of such limits, namely
      toric degenerations, that captures the mirror map in terms of combinatorial data
      on the SYZ base. The goal of this talk is to provide an elementary overview of some
      of the motivation behind this seemingly technical approach to mirror symmetry and,
      if time permits, touch on analogies with certain differential-geometric constructions
      in hyperkähler geometry.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> 27 lines on a cubic surface, revisited</p>
    <p class="justify">
      Among the most well-known results in classical algebraic geometry, due to Cayley and Salmon,
      is the fact that every smooth cubic surface in P^3 over the complex numbers contains exactly
      27 lines. Kass and Wickelgren proved a far-reaching generalization of this result for lines
      on cubics over an arbitrary field F. In their version, the "number" of lines is an element
      of GW(F), the Grothendieck--Witt group of quadratic forms over F. The aim of this talk is to
      motivate, and explain some of the key ingredients in, their work.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Apollonian carpets and the boundary of the Kähler cone of a hyperkähler manifold </p>
    <p class="justify">
      The ample cone of a compact Kähler n-manifold M
      is the intersection of its Kähler cone and the real subspace generated
      by integer (1,1)-classes. Its isotropic boundary is the set of all
      points η on its boundary such that ∫_M η^n=0.
      We are interested in the relation between the shape of the isotropic
      boundary of the ample cone of a hyperkahler manifold and the dynamics of
      its holomorphic automorphism group G. In this case, the projectivization
      of the ample cone is realized as an open, locally polyhedral subset
      in a hyperbolic space H. The isotropic boundary S is realized as a subset
      of the hyperbolic boundary (the absolute) A of H, which is naturally identified
      with a Euclidean sphere. It is clear that the isotropic boundary S contains
      the limit set of G acting on its ample cone. We prove that, conversely,
      all irrational points on S belong to the limit set. Using a result of N. Shah
      about limiting distributions of curves under geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds, we
      prove that every real analytic curve in S is contained in a geodesic sphere in S, and
      in presence of such curves the limit set is the closure of the union of
      these geodesic spheres. We study the geometry of such fractal sets,
      called Apollonian carpets, and establish the link between the Apollonian
      carpet and the structure of the automorphism group.
