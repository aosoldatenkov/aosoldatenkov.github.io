    <p><strong>Title: </strong>From Theory to Computation: Unraveling Hyperplane Arrangements</p>
    <p class="justify">A hyperplane arrangement is a finite collection
      of codimension-one affine subspaces within a finite-dimensional
      vector space. The study of these arrangements draws from various
      branches of mathematics, uncovering deep and often surprising
      connections between combinatorics, algebra, algebraic geometry,
      and topology. In this seminar, we will explore some of the intriguing
      properties of hyperplane arrangements and highlight the computational
      challenges that arise in their analysis.

    <p><strong>Title: </strong>Contando pontos racionais com a teoria
      de Stöhr-Voloch e resultados de Tate e Shafarevich</p>
    <p class="justify">Nesta apresentação, irei discorrer sobre alguns
      dos meus últimos tópicos de pesquisa, envolvendo o número de pontos
      racionais de curvas definidas sobre corpos finitos. A primeira parte
      deste trabalho envolve a teoria de Stöhr-Voloch. Nós classificamos
      as curvas trinomiais que são Frobenius não clássicas com respeito
      ao morfismo de retas, e obtivemos uma fórmula para o seu número
      de pontos racionais. Além disso, conseguimos classificar também
      as curvas quadrinomiais que são dadas por polinômios com variáveis
      separadas. A segunda parte deste trabalho envolve superfícies elípticas
      que podem ser vistas como curvas elípticas sobre corpos de funções
      de característica 3. A partir de uma curva elíptica supersingular
      fixada sobre F<sub>9</sub>, nós obtivemos fórmulas para o posto
      de Mordell-Weil de algumas twists delas em extensões de Artin-Schreier
      e Kummer do corpo de funções de uma curva. Este é um trabalho
      em colaboração com Tiago Aprigio e Herivelto Borges, e foi financiado,
      em partes, por CAPES, CNPq e FAPESP.

    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Matija Tapuskovic (University of Oxford)</p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Motivic Galois theory of algebraic Mellin transforms</p>
    <p class="justify"> In this talk, I will introduce the theory of algebraic
      Mellin transforms and their local expansions as power series whose coefficients
      are periods in the sense of Kontsevich—Zagier. We will see how this theory
      relates to the classical motivic Galois theory of periods — such as multiple
      zeta values — and how this action can be naturally extended to the full
      power series expansions of algebraic Mellin transforms. Remarkably, this allows us
      to encode the motivic Galois action on infinitely many periods using finite formulas.
      This framework provides a unified perspective on diverse examples,
      including dimensionally regularised Feynman integrals, Lauricella
      hypergeometric functions, and beyond. This is joint work with Francis Brown,
      Clément Dupont, and Javier Fresán.

    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Daniel Fadel (ICMC-USP)</p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Existence and energy concentration of SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs critical points on 3-manifolds</p>
    <p class="justify">I will present recent joint work with Da Rong Cheng (Miami)
      and Luiz Lara (Unicamp) on the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs functional with arbitrary
      positive coupling constant over oriented Riemannian 3-manifolds. This gauge-invariant
      energy is defined on pairs consisting of a connection on an SU(2)-bundle and a section
      of the adjoint bundle, and its critical points are solutions to a nonlinear
      second-order elliptic system modulo gauge.
      <br>
      Motivated by the work of Pigati and Stern (2021) on the abelian case, we introduce
      a scaling parameter and study sequences of critical points of the rescaled functional
      under natural energy bounds. On 3-manifolds with bounded geometry, we show that,
      as the parameter tends to zero, energy concentrates at a finite set of points,
      while the remaining energy is accounted for by the formation of an L<sup>2</sup>
      harmonic 1-form. Around each concentration point, a finite collection of “bubbles”
      arises — non-trivial critical points on R<sup>3</sup> for the rescaled functional
      with parameter equal to one. An energy gap result, together with a no-neck property,
      ensures that the total concentrated energy at each point is precisely the sum
      of the energies of finitely many such bubbles.
      <br>
      On closed 3-manifolds, we adapt the min-max construction of Pigati and Stern to the
      SU(2) setting and, for sufficiently small values of the scaling parameter,
      establish the existence of non-trivial critical points satisfying energy bounds
      natural from the scaling perspective. When the manifold is a rational homology
      3-sphere, we ensure the occurrence of non-trivial bubbling, which in turn implies
      the existence of non-trivial critical points on R<sup>3</sup>.
      <br>
      If time permits, I will conclude with open questions and potential extensions to higher dimensions.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> The geometry of M<sub>1,3</sub></p>
    <p class="justify">Let M<sub>1,n</sub > be the moduli space of genus 1 curves with n marked points.
      Belorousski showed that these moduli spaces are rational algebraic
      varieties for n less or equal to 10. A cohomology computation, or a
      point count over finite fields, suggests another property: the motive of
      M<sub>1,n</sub> is expected to be mixed Tate for n in the same range. I'll
      describe explicit, and rather elementary, stratifications of M<sub>1,1</sub>,
      M<sub>1,2</sub> and M<sub>1,3</sub> which show in particular the mixed Tate property in
      these cases. This is joint work with Francis Brown.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Brill-Noether theory for the moduli space of vector bundles</p>
    <p class="justify">The moduli space of vector bundles on smooth projective varieties
      were constructed using GIT in the 70’s. Since then, these moduli spaces have been
      studied extensively by several authors. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that
      in spite of big efforts, there is still a huge number of very hard questions left open.
      A crucial problem is to determine the geometry of the moduli space in terms of the
      existence and structure of their subvarieties. 
      <br>
      One of subvarieties that have been of great interest are the Brill-Noether subvarieties.
      A Brill-Noether subvariety is a subset of the moduli space whose points correspond
      to bundles having at least k independent global sections. The main goal of Brill-Noether
      theory is the study of these subsets, in particular questions concerning non-emptiness,
      connectedness, irreducibility, dimension, singularities, and topological and
      geometric structures. In this talk, I will present a broad overview of Brill–Noether
      theory in the classical setting of algebraic curves, I will show some results
      for Brill-Noether theory on surfaces.

    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Arpan Saha (UNICAMP)</p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Resurgence in enumerative geometry</p>
    <p class="justify">Gromov–Witten and Donaldson–Thomas invariants are
      enumerative invariants that can be defined for any Calabi–Yau threefold.
      Roughly speaking, GW invariants count holomorphic curves together with a
      parametrisation while DT invariants count them together with the data
      of the equations defining them. These two different ways of interpreting
      a curve lead to different behaviour under degenerations and so
      different counts. Nevertheless, it has been conjectured by
      Maulik–Nekrasov–Okounkov–Pandharipande that knowing any one of
      these two sets of invariants is sufficient to completely determine the
      other. Motivated by physical intuition from topological string theory,
      we shall be exploring in this talk an elegant realisation of this
      equivalence in the case of the resolved conifold, a particular example
      of a noncompact Calabi–Yau threefold, within the framework of resurgence
      theory. This is based on joint work with Murad Alim, Jörg Teschner, and Iván
      Tulli.

    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Dmitry Korshunov (IMPA)</p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Hölder potentials in hyperkähler dynamics</p>
    <p class="justify">Cantat and Dinh-Sibony studied so called dynamic currents associated to
      hyperbolic automorphisms of Calabi-Yau manifolds. They are defined as
      eigenvectors in H<sup>1,1</sup> with eigenvalue >1. They are of interest in
      dynamics, because they allow to construct dynamically interesting
      measures, and for algebraic geometry they provide examples of rigid
      currents. I will describe the circle of ideas around these themes and
      report on a work in progress with Misha Verbitsky generalizing a theorem
      of Dinh and Sibony stating that potentials of dynamic currents are
      Hölder functions.

    <p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Arpan Saha (UNICAMP)</p>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> An invitation to the Gross–Siebert programme</p>
    <p class="justify">
      The Strominger–Yau–Zaslow conjecture is a geometric shadow of mirror symmetry
      that interprets mirror manifolds as dual special lagrangian fibrations over
      the same base. The naive statement of the conjecture turns out to be false but
      may be rescued in certain large complex structure limits. The toric degeneration
      programme due to Mark Gross and Bernd Siebert is an algebro-geometric realisation
      of the above conjectural statement motivated by a class of such limits, namely
      toric degenerations, that captures the mirror map in terms of combinatorial data
      on the SYZ base. The goal of this talk is to provide an elementary overview of some
      of the motivation behind this seemingly technical approach to mirror symmetry and,
      if time permits, touch on analogies with certain differential-geometric constructions
      in hyperkähler geometry.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> 27 lines on a cubic surface, revisited</p>
    <p class="justify">
      Among the most well-known results in classical algebraic geometry, due to Cayley and Salmon,
      is the fact that every smooth cubic surface in P<sup>3</sup> over the complex numbers contains exactly
      27 lines. Kass and Wickelgren proved a far-reaching generalization of this result for lines
      on cubics over an arbitrary field F. In their version, the "number" of lines is an element
      of GW(F), the Grothendieck--Witt group of quadratic forms over F. The aim of this talk is to
      motivate, and explain some of the key ingredients in, their work.

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Apollonian carpets and the boundary of the Kähler cone of a hyperkähler manifold </p>
    <p class="justify">
      The ample cone of a compact Kähler n-manifold M
      is the intersection of its Kähler cone and the real subspace generated
      by integer (1,1)-classes. Its isotropic boundary is the set of all
      points η on its boundary such that ∫<sub>M</sub> η<sup>n</sup>=0.
      We are interested in the relation between the shape of the isotropic
      boundary of the ample cone of a hyperkahler manifold and the dynamics of
      its holomorphic automorphism group G. In this case, the projectivization
      of the ample cone is realized as an open, locally polyhedral subset
      in a hyperbolic space H. The isotropic boundary S is realized as a subset
      of the hyperbolic boundary (the absolute) A of H, which is naturally identified
      with a Euclidean sphere. It is clear that the isotropic boundary S contains
      the limit set of G acting on its ample cone. We prove that, conversely,
      all irrational points on S belong to the limit set. Using a result of N. Shah
      about limiting distributions of curves under geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds, we
      prove that every real analytic curve in S is contained in a geodesic sphere in S, and
      in presence of such curves the limit set is the closure of the union of
      these geodesic spheres. We study the geometry of such fractal sets,
      called Apollonian carpets, and establish the link between the Apollonian
      carpet and the structure of the automorphism group.
