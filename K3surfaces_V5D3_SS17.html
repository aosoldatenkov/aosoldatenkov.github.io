<h1> V5D3 - Advanced Topics in Geometry - Introduction to K3 surfaces, Summer semester 2017</h1>

<p><strong>Lecturer:</strong> Dr. Andrey Soldatenkov<br>
</p>

<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p class="justify"> Classification of complex algebraic surfaces is a classical chapter of algebraic geometry
which was essentially completed by the Italian school in the beginning of the previous century.
Surfaces with trivial canonical bundle occupy a special place in this classification.
There are two types of such surfaces: abelian surfaces and K3 surfaces.
Abelian surfaces may be viewed as a straightforward two-dimensional analogue of elliptic curves.
On the other hand, K3 surfaces present a new class of algebraic varieties with its own unique features.
Several decades of study showed that the theory of K3 surfaces is remarkably rich and deep.
We will start from a general introduction to the theory of algebraic surfaces, and
then pass to the study of complex K3 surfaces. We will focus on the Hodge-theoretic
and differential-geometric parts of the theory leading to the proof of global Torelli theorem.
